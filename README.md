A Chrome extension typically consists of:
- Manifest file (manifest.json): Declares metadata about the extension.
- Background scripts: Runs in the background and manages event listeners.
- Content scripts: Runs in the context of web pages and interacts with the DOM.
- Popup or UI components: Optional components for user interaction.
